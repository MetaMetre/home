# MetaMetre readme
Hello, startup and NFT enthusiasts!

The big corporations are creating their own meta universes right now. Already heard about it, did you?

In this universes people from all over the world in the form of avatars will be able to virtually communicate, make purchases, work and relax 24 for 7 and 365 days a year.
In general, things are all that you are used to doing in the real world, just from the comfort of your home. 

Sounds great, right?

But, this all will not give anything new only keeping the distance and the fan. The people's lives will not get better and the world will not change, because of the economic model which will be same - The rich will get richer and the poor will get poorer 
We are creating a different meta-world.
Not to enrich corporations, but to improve the real lives of ordinary people.

The construction of the first MetaMarket tower is starting Right now! 
The MetaMarket – a virtual skyscraper mall that will gradually build several thousand floors, and the number of which is unlimited. It creates retail spaces for different countries and cities. 
The users will be able to go shopping on their phones or PC, by using augmented (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies.
 
Here in this meta mall you can twist the goods in your hands, try on clothes and shoes, make payments, and so on, as in ordinary shopping centers.
This is the future, guys!

Customers will receive all purchases in the physical world, as if making a purchase in a regular store. One thing in this mall will be different, here the buying means getting rich. You will receive money for making purchases in the tower and, in addition, gradually become a MetaMarket co-owner.


How does it work?
Our team knows very, well how the international economy works and how new money is created. 
And we are not talking about loans, but about added value.

In simple words,

The more you buy – the more you get vouchers and deductions for them, and, accordingly, money. Thanks to this, the standard of living increases, consumption increases, and the economy grows. People get richer. This works according to the algorithm embedded in Metaworld and Metamarket. 

That's what it's built for.

What kind of customers and entrepreneurs is designed for Metamarket?
First of all, it affects countries with lower-middle-income levels that need to improve their living standards, for example, the following countries: Latin America, Africa, and India, as well as entrepreneurs in these countries.

What sales volumes is it designed for Metamarket?
The meta-universe market is in its infancy and in the next 3-5 years, according to our estimates, will reach a turnover of several hundred billion dollars per month.

Who is our team?
Our Startup is the result of the work of an international team from 5 countries (Singapore, Hong Kong, Venezuela, Philippines and China), which works mostly remotely. The team has all the necessary experience and competencies in the required areas.

Taxation
All transactions in the DWTC special zone are tax-free, buyers do not pay anything extra, and entrepreneurs conduct normal business activities, receiving valuable artifacts from the Metaworld.

Scaling
It is provided by modern engaging technology that changes people's opinions and behavior, with subsequent involvement through social connections, which is us know how.

Using NFT as a money
In our metamarket, NFTs with the stablecoin function will be used as a means of payment. 
Consumers will be able to receive them through public exchange operations.

Imagine that it all works through NFT! 

These are Non-fungible token, if someone is not in the subject.)

We've only added a couple of innovative features to them here :

1)	NFT Function as Crowdfunding 
To finance the construction of the MetaWorld and the Metamarket tower, the virtual area under the tower is sold as an NFT, which gives the buyer exclusive ownership. In total, there are 14,400 square meters of virtual land under the tower, some of which will be put up for sale at a fixed price, such as the first 50 square meters. The rest will be sold through auctions, which will ensure a constant increase in the cost of each square meter of virtual land.

What does this mean?
Land owners will receive a monthly percentage of all purchases and payments from thousands of floors of the tower. This will make a lot of money. 

2)	NFT as a stock. The more floors, retail outlets, purchases in a skyscraper – the more benefits to the owner of the NFT (virtual land under the building).
And since the issue of square meters is limited, and demand will exceed supply– the value of NFT will grow endlessly.

We have developed and are implementing Metaworld based on the principles of justice, and with us every user of our Metamarket easily realizes their basic human rights.


Result:
We are selling virtual land under the Metamarket tower.
We create Metaworld with the received money. 
We create business skyscrapers in it:
- with integration for entrepreneurs
- with an economy, that works according to specified algorithms
-the interface allows users to top up their personal balance, make purchases
- create virtual stores, services, etc. for entrepreneurs.
- involve users and entrepreneurs
- start processes
- the algorithm deducts % monthly to the owners of the land under the skyscraper.

Note:
At the first stage, a small part of the land for a business skyscraper will be sold and % of the sales will be distributed among a small number of landowners.
The increase in the turnover of the skyscraper will be much faster than the sale of the following parts of the land. Therefore, the share will not be eroded by the sales of the next shares, but will give more and more money.
The land will be sold in portions. The first 50 m2 at a fixed price of 1 ETH, followed by auctions. From the moment of launch, land prices will skyrocket.
It will be more and more deficit on. And in the end it will all be sold out.

Start-up investors and NFT enthusiasts should take this, into account when choosing how to deal with the possibility of buying virtual land in an innovative world with total advantages over other created ones!
