Hello, startup and NFT enthusiasts! Happy New Year 2022!
The big corporations are creating their own meta universes right now. Already heard about it, did you?

In this universes people from all over the world in the form of avatars will be able to virtually communicate, make purchases, work and relax 24 for 7 and 365 days a year.
In general, things are all that you are used to doing in the real world, just from the comfort of your home. 

Sounds great, right?
But, this all will not give anything new only keeping the distance and the fan. The people's lives will not get better and the world will not change, because of the economic model which will be same - The rich will get richer and the poor will get poorer ÔÅå
We are creating a different meta-world.
